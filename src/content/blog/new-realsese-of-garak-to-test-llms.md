garak (Generative AI Red-teaming & Assessment Kit) is an open-source LLM vulnerability scanner developed and maintained by NVIDIA's AI Red Team.

Often described as the "Nmap for LLMs," it is a command-line tool designed to stress-test Large Language Models (LLMs) and dialog systems to discover security weaknesses and alignment failures.
