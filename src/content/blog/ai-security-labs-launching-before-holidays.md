**Vortex Node AI Security Labs** are currently in beta.

## What Are the Labs?

Vortex Node AI Security Labs is an interactive, hands-on platform for learning and practicing AI security testing. The labs feature 30+ real-world challenges covering the OWASP LLM Top 10, including prompt injection, supply chain attacks, model security, code execution vulnerabilities, and more.

Each challenge is designed to simulate actual AI security scenarios you might encounter in production environments. From basic prompt injection techniques to complex multi-vector attacks, the labs provide a safe environment to develop and refine your AI security testing skills.

## Gamification and Learning

The platform uses a gamified approach to make learning engaging and trackable. Challenges are categorized by difficulty (Easy to Very Hard) and award points based on complexity. This scoring system helps you:

- Track your progress as you advance through different skill levels
- Compete with the community on leaderboards
- Identify areas where you need more practice
- Build a portfolio of completed challenges

## Discord-Driven Community

The entire lab experience is managed and started through our Discord server, which serves as the central hub for:

- **Challenge Access**: Start challenges directly from Discord using our bot
- **Community Support**: Get help, share writeups, and discuss techniques with other security professionals
- **Real-Time Updates**: Receive notifications about new challenges, updates, and community achievements
- **Collaboration**: Form teams, share strategies, and learn from each other's approaches

## Beta Status

The labs are currently in **beta**, which means:

- Core functionality is live and working
- Challenges are being tested and refined based on community feedback
- New challenges are being added regularly
- Infrastructure is being optimized for performance

## Launch Timeline

We're targeting a **full launch before the holidays this year**. This means:

- All planned challenges will be available
- Full gamification features will be active
- Community features will be fully integrated
- Documentation and writeups will be complete
