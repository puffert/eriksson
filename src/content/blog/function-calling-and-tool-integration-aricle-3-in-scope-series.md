Models with function calling can execute code and query databases. Scoping ignores the execution layer.

What gets missed:

Authorization for function calls
Parameter validation (SQL injection, command injection, path traversal)
Function call chains
Rate limiting on expensive functions
Testing the model doesn’t cover what the model can do through tools.
