AI Security Scoping: What Organizations Get Wrong

Organizations are deploying AI systems into production. Security teams are being asked to assess them. And most security scoping documents are fundamentally inadequate for the task.

The problem isn't that security teams lack expertise. The problem is that AI systems are different from traditional applications, and scoping approaches haven't adapted. Scope documents say "test the LLM" without defining what that means. They apply web application security frameworks to systems where the attack surface is fundamentally different.

This series addresses the gap between how organizations scope AI security assessments and what actually needs to be tested.
