Impressive use of AI in RE.

Researchers used generative AI to analyze the XLoader 8.0 malware, a variant known for multi-layer encryption and obfuscation. By feeding disassembly data (from IDA Pro) and runtime values (from a debugger) into the AI, the team automated the reverse-engineering process.

​This AI-assisted workflow successfully identified the malware's modified RC4 and XOR encryption algorithms, generated Python scripts to decrypt its code, and deobfuscated its hidden Windows API calls. 

The process uncovered over 100 encrypted functions and 64 hidden command-and-control (C2) domains, reducing the analysis from days to hours.
