Organizations use OpenAI or Anthropic APIs. Scope says “test the model” when the model is a black box.

What gets missed:

Trust boundary definition
What’s actually testable (integration, not the model)
Data sent to third-party APIs
Compliance implications
You can’t test the model. You can test your integration with it.
