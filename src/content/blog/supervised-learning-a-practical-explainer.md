Trying to understand supervised learning can be tough. 

Supervised learning is the branch of ML where each example already comes with the correct answer. The goal is to learn a rule that maps **features** (inputs) --> **label** (output) in a way that holds up on new data, not just the data you trained on.

A simple analogy helps which I saw on HTB. 

_Teaching a child fruits: show an apple and say “apple,” an orange and say “orange.” Over time the child connects characteristics (color, shape, size) --> correct name and can label new fruits. Supervised learning follows the same pattern: provide labeled examples, learn the mapping, predict for unseen cases._
