I have long been a big fan of HTB. Had a few years I did not use the academy but started this year just for the AI red team path. Sure I am one of those that does not like when everything is called red team, it's no exception here. The path has nothing to do with RT it's just normal security assessment it goes trough. 

However,  the path is really good. Starts of with theory of AI/ML the dives into more specifics
 Its follows the owasp.

Clearly worth the price compared to other offensive security courses.

A tip is to experiment yourself. 

I had the opportunity to use Cursor to solve some of the assignments. Seeing how an AI actually will manipulate another AI was intressting.  I will post about it later, but it was surprisingly good at it.
