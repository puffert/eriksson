## The Five-Layer AI Stack

Modern AI systems follow a structured architecture. Each layer serves a defined purpose, enabling predictable performance and controlled scalability. The stack consists of five components: Infrastructure, Models, Data, Orchestration, and Applications.

### 1. Infrastructure

This layer provides the computational foundation.
It includes GPU clusters, high-speed networking, distributed storage, and containerized environments.
Its function is to supply stable and repeatable performance for model training and inference.

### 2. Models

This layer contains the core intelligence.
It includes foundation models, fine-tuned variants, and domain-specific inference engines.
The layer is responsible for reasoning, pattern recognition, and decision generation.

### 3. Data

The data layer defines what the system knows.
It includes vector databases, document stores, preprocessing pipelines, and retrieval systems.
The objective is to ensure model inputs are accurate, current, and structured for efficient consumption.

### 4. Orchestration

This layer directs the flow of information and behavior.
It manages prompts, workflows, agent logic, tool calling, routing, and guardrails.
Its purpose is to create predictable, controlled interactions between models and external systems.

### 5. Applications

The top layer exposes AI capabilities to users and services.
It includes chat interfaces, automation systems, analytics tools, and business integrations.
This is where the operational value of the entire stack becomes visible.

## Conclusion

The AI stack is not a single technology. It is a layered system engineered for clarity, reliability, and scale.
Understanding the five layers—Infrastructure, Models, Data, Orchestration, and Applications—provides a stable framework for designing and deploying modern AI solutions.
