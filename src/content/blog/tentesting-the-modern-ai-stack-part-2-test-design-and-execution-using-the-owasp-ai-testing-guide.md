title: "Tentesting the Modern AI Stack (Part 2): Test Design and Execution Using the OWASP AI Testing Guide"
description: "- Infrastructure compromise gives you **capability**, not automatic AI-specific **effects**. Treat these separately in scope and reporting. - AI systems are probabilistic. Every test case needs defined inputs, expected outcomes, evidence sources, and repro rules. - Use IBM's five-layer AI stack model (Infrastructure → Model → Data → Orchestration → Application) for systematic coverage. - The OWASP AI Testing Guide provides structured test cases across four categories. This article maps them to the five-layer model. - Document everything: trace IDs, prompt logs, tool-call logs, retrieval logs."
